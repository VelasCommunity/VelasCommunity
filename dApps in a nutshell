Decentralized apps show but one major difference from a range of usual solutions - you may only run them via a blockchain. Powered by smart contracts, dApps are ultimately protected from any third-party intrusion.
Open-source. The open-sourced foundation allows dApps to run autonomously.

Transparency. dApp data and records are highly available, since they are public.

Safety. dApp creators use a crypto token to help keep the network environment safe.
